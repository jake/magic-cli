# Commando
Thinko's command line tools. Based on [magic-cli](http://github.com/slackhq/magic-cli) by Slack.

## Customization
You can add a human-readable description in that list by putting a comment immediately under the `#!` line:

````bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This line will be shown in the list of commands.
````

You can also define any extra parameters that are required for the script with a `# @param` line for each parameter:

````bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This line will be shown in the list of commands.
# @param <command_param> - Longer Description of the Parameter
# @param - If you donâ€™t give a parameter name, a default one will be created for you
````

If using Ruby, there are some useful helpers available. Description will pulled from `commander` definition.

````ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require_relative 'commando-helpers.rb'
